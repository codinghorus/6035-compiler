==Grammar==

===Clarification/addition/assumptions===
I believe my implementation returns a better result for char4 than the default
testcase. Although the escape sequence is invalid, the char is otherwise
syntactically correct so it makes little sense to me to return a spurious
"unexpected newline" error in addition to flagging the invalid escape sequence.

==Overview of design, analysis of alternatives, and design decisions==


==Implementation issues==
The most frustrating experience I had with implementation was testcase char4.

==Commented source code==
See src/edu/mit/compilers/lizfong/grammar/{lexer,parser}.g
I believe the code to be adequately commented, with no need for further
copy-pasting of the file contents here.

==Known problems==
None current.
